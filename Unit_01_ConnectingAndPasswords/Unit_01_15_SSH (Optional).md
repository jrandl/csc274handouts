# Unit 01 15 SSH (Optional)

If you are logging in from a Mac or Linux you will probably want to use this method of logging in.  Windows users may also use it if they have WSL2 installed on their system.

Your password will be provided by your instructor

In the following example, the userid is *abyron* but yours will be different

1. Open a terminal window.  
2. Type the following into your console or terminal:

```bash
$ ssh abyron@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu
```

This is probably your first login to this computer so you will be prompted with a security warning.  If you get the warning type "y" and hit enter.  You should not get this warning again unless you log in from a different computer or use different software.

You should now be prompted for your user name.  

You may be prompted for a passoword or you may be prompted to enter a password.
