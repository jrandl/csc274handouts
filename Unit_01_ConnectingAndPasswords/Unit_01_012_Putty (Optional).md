# Unit 01.12  Putty

This section is optional.  Students with old versions of Windows will probably have to use Putty or some other software.  But any Windows user should be able to use Putty.

However, even people who have ssh available in their local terminals may prefer putty or bitvise.

Use whatever you want, but I would prefer that you not use bitvise until after midterm-ish.

## Putty

* https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
* Get 64-bit version,  putty-64bit-0.71-installer.msi
      * (The 0.71 might change)

After installing, type turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu in the Host area.

There are ways to refine Putty.  They will be shown in the accompanying video.
