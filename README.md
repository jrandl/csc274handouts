Depending on pandemic conditions and the odd format of the class, it may be that we do not get through all 14 units.  In that case I will try to add resources for you here or in Canvas.
  

## The MIT "Missing Semester" project:

The [MIT "Missing Semester" project](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is potentially a useful resource for this course.  If you have trouble understanding a unit, one option is to find the overlapping topics in the MIT "Missing Semester" course.  It also covers topics like GIT.
