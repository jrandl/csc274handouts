  - Note that we started counting with 0, so this is actually the 15th unit.  MWSU semesters are currently 14 weeks long.  Therefore we will not cover this during the semester.  I may put some resources here for you to explore after the semester.
  

## The MIT "Missing Semester" project:

The [MIT "Missing Semester" project](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is potentially a useful resource for this course.  If you have trouble understanding a unit, one option is to find the overlapping topics in the MIT "Missing Semester" course.
