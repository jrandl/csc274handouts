# Unit 01
> *Connecting, Commands, Man Pages, and Passwords*

Pro tip: *I suggest that you print out these sheets and take notes on them.*

## Connecting

* For Windows 10 (late versions)
  * open cmd, PowerShell, bash, or Windows Terminal
* For older Windows systems, use Putty (instructions elsewhere)
  * Even Windows 10 users might want to use putty.
* For Linux or Macs
  * Open a terminal window
  
Terms that mean about the same thing:  terminal window, console window, command window, CLI

#### Login Id and password

Your login should be the same as your Missouri Western goldlink login id.

Your password will be provided by your instructor

In the following example, the userid is *alovelace* but yours will be different

Type the following into your console or terminal:

    ssh alovelace@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

## Our working environment

### turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu ![turing](images/turing.jpg)


### Motivations

In the first part of the semester we will be connecting to the same server.  There are several reasons for this:

* Easier setup for students at the start of class
* Everyone is working in the same environment
* The environment is less likely to be damaged by a sudo accident.
* Remote server is a realistic working scenario
* We can have some fun.

## Before we connect

* In this course you will use the same userid as you use to log in to Goldlink and Canvas at Missouri Western.
* Your password will be different
  * Your instructor will send you the original password to use in this course.
  * We will change the password in one of the early exercises.

## Connecting to turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

* Windows
  * Putty
    * https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
    * Get 64-bit version,  putty-64bit-0.71-installer.msi
      * (The 0.71 might change)
* Linux and Mac
  * Open a terminal window
  * Type the following command.  Use your login id In this case, I am assuming the login email address of the person is abyron@missouriwestern.edu
     ssh alovelace@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

  ## Strings

  There are several ways to make strings  For right now we will only talk about three ways


* Naked
  * Best used when there are no spaces or punctuation
        > echo Hello
        > cowsay Hello
* Single Quote '
  * an apostrophy to a normal human
  * may be used around single words
  * more efficient than double quotes
  * **Best practice is to get in the habit of using single quotes**
       > echo 'Hello, World'
       > cowsay 'Hello, World'
       > cowsay 'Hello, $USER'
* Double Quote "
  * just a normal quote mark to a normal human
  * may be used around single words
  * less efficient than double quotes
  * **Best practice is to get in the habit of using single quotes**
       
       Hit the up arrow once and change the single quotes to double
       > cowsay "Hello, $USER"
       > cowsay -d "Hello, $USER"

#### Getting out of trouble with Ctrl-c

It is easy to forget a closing quote mark.  If that happens it may look like the system is hung up.  Don't panic.  Hold down the Ctrl key and hit c.  Ctrl-C is often called ***"Break"*** and can be your best friend.

Type the following command.  It measure verifies that we have a network connection and measures the time it takes to send messages to computer.  
(There are a thousand milliseconds in a second, so 100 ms would be a tenth of a second.)

    > ping example.com

The problem is the command runs forever.  Hit Ctrl-c to break.

Now try the following while logged into turing

    > ping www.missouriwestern.edu

    > ping turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu
