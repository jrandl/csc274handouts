# Unit 00
> *Connecting, Commands, Man Pages, and Passwords*


## Our working environment

### turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu ![turing](images/turing.jpg)

## Connecting

* For Windows 10 (late versions)
  * open cmd, PowerShell, bash, or Windows Terminal
* For older Windows systems, use Putty (instructions elsewhere)
  * Even Windows 10 users might want to use putty.
* For Linux or Macs
  * Open a terminal window
  
Terms that mean about the same thing:  terminal window, console window, command window, CLI

#### Login Id and password

Your login should be the same as your Missouri Western goldlink login id.

Your password will be provided by your instructor

In the following example, the userid is *alovelace* but yours will be different

Type the following into your console or terminal:

    ssh alovelace@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

### Motivations

In the first part of the semester we will be connecting to the same server.  There are several reasons for this:

* Easier setup for students at the start of class
* Everyone is working in the same environment
* The environment is less likely to be damaged by a sudo accident.
* Remote server is a realistic working scenario
* We can have some fun.

## Before we connect

* In this course you will use the same userid as you use to log in to Goldlink and Canvas at Missouri Western.
* Your password will be different
  * Your instructor will send you the original password to use in this course.
  * We will change the password in one of the early exercises.

## Connecting to turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

* Windows
  * Putty
    * https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
    * Get 64-bit version,  putty-64bit-0.71-installer.msi
      * (The 0.71 might change)
* Linux and Mac
  * Open a terminal window
  * Type the following command.  Use your login id In this case, I am assuming the login email address of the person is abyron@missouriwestern.edu
     ssh alovelace@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu
