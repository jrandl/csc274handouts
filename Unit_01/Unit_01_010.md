## Connecting

### Our working environment

#### turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

In the first part of the semester we will be connecting to the same server.  There are several reasons for this:

* Easier setup for students at the start of class
* Everyone is working in the same environment
* The environment is less likely to be damaged by a sudo accident.
* Remote server is a realistic working scenario
* We can have some fun.

## Connecting to turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu
