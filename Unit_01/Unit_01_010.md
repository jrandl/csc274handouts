# Unit 01
> *Connecting, Commands, Man Pages, and Passwords*

Pro tip: *I suggest that you print out these sheets and take notes on them.*

## Connecting

* For Windows 10 (late versions)
  * open cmd, PowerShell, bash, or Windows Terminal
* For older Windows systems, use Putty (instructions elsewhere)
  * Even Windows 10 users might want to use putty.
* For Linux or Macs
  * Open a terminal window
  
Terms that mean about the same thing:  terminal window, console window, command window, CLI

#### Login Id and password

Your login should be the same as your Missouri Western goldlink login id.

Your password will be provided by your instructor

In the following example, the userid is *alovelace* but yours will be different

Type the following into your console or terminal:

    ssh alovelace@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

## Our working environment

### turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu ![turing](images/turing.jpg)


### Motivations

In the first part of the semester we will be connecting to the same server.  There are several reasons for this:

* Easier setup for students at the start of class
* Everyone is working in the same environment
* The environment is less likely to be damaged by a sudo accident.
* Remote server is a realistic working scenario
* We can have some fun.

## Commands in this lesson

Some of these commands will be covered in the videos, and some in the assignments.

I suggest you note what each of the following does as you go through the vieos.  Before taking the quiz use the "man" utility to figure out what the other commands do.  (Using man will be covered in one of this unit's videos.)

* whoami
* exit
* echo
* cowsay
* figlet
* date
* cal
* finger
* ls
* wget
* chfn
* finger
* passwd
* mkpasswdf
* cal
* ping
  
##  Keystrokes used in this lesson
  
### Keystrokes at the shell level

* Ctrl-c
* Up-arrow
* tab
  
## Commands

* case sensitive
* often terse or parsimonious
  * old commands are often 2 or 3 letters
  * often no unneeded output.  Sometimes none

  ## Strings

  There are several ways to make strings  For right now we will only talk about three ways


* Naked
  * Best used when there are no spaces or punctuation
```bash
$ echo Hello
$ cowsay Hello
```
* Single Quote '
  * an apostrophy to a normal human
  * may be used around single words
  * more efficient than double quotes
  * **Best practice is to get in the habit of using single quotes**

```bash
$ echo 'Hello, World'
$ cowsay 'Hello, World'
$ cowsay 'Hello, $USER'
```

* Double Quote "
  * just a normal quote mark to a normal human
  * may be used around single words
  * less efficient than double quotes
  * **Best practice is to get in the habit of using single quotes**
```bash
   Hit the up arrow once and change the single quotes to double
$ cowsay "Hello, $USER"
$ cowsay -w "Hello, $USER"
$ cowsay -t "Hello, $USER"
$ cowsay -d "Hello, $USER"

```
#### Getting out of trouble with Ctrl-c

It is easy to forget a closing quote mark.  If that happens it may look like the system is hung up.  Don't panic.  Hold down the Ctrl key and hit c.  Ctrl-C is often called ***"Break"*** and can be your best friend.

Type the following command.  It measure verifies that we have a network connection and measures the time it takes to send messages to computer.  
(There are a thousand milliseconds in a second, so 100 ms would be a tenth of a second.)

$ ping example.com

The problem is the command runs forever.  Hit Ctrl-c to break.

Now try the following while logged into turing
```bash
$ ping www.missouriwestern.edu
$ ping turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu
```

## Pipes Interlude

Pipes will not be on this quiz.  Pipes will be covered in a later unit.  However, in this unit we will introduce using them.  Hopefully they will not feel as odd when we get to them.

Most commands can take their input from the keyboard and send send output to the screen. 

Commands can be combined with a | (or "pipe") symbol.  It is usually on the right side of the keyboard above the enter key.

Try this:

``` bash
$ date
```

Now "pipe" the output of the date command as input to the cowsay command.

```bash
$ date  |  cowsay
```

Reminder.  Pipes will not be on the Unit 1 quiz.  But they are useful and pretty easy.

## Man Pages

Man is short for "manuals"

A lot of the commands seem weird.  But they are also used in a couple of other programs so learning the common ones pay off.

* ***"q" to quit.***
* "h" gets you help.
* The man command uses the "less" program. More on less later.
* Space moves you forward one page.  But you can use page up and page down.
* / for forward search.  Then n to move to next match or N for previous match

The ^ symbol means "Ctrl"

### Keystrokes in man pages

* q
* space (same as PgDn)
* PgUp
* /
* n and N (they are different in man pages)

* **Bold** text means to use it exactly.
* *Italics* or italics means substiture with something approrpriate.
* [optional]  There are variations.  See the help pages, but the most important thing is that [ ] means the arguments are optional.

### Old fashioned 

Usually a single dash followed by a single letter

```bash
$ cowsay -d  "Dashing"
