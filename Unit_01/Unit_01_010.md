# Unit 01

> *Connecting, Commands, Man Pages, and Passwords*

Pro tip: *I suggest that you print out these sheets and take notes on them.*

Parental Warning:  Some of the cowfiles may be NSFW.  The ones I am using in examples are SFW.  If you go exploring be over 18 and be prepared for possible objectionalable images.

## Connecting

* For Windows 10 (late versions)
  * open cmd, PowerShell, bash, or Windows Terminal
* For older Windows systems, use Putty (instructions elsewhere)
  * Even Windows 10 users might want to use putty.
* For Linux or Macs
  * Open a terminal window
  
Terms that mean about the same thing:  terminal window, console window, command
 window, CLI

### Login Id and password

Your login should be the same as your Missouri Western goldlink login id.

Your password will be provided by your instructor

In the following example, the userid is *alovelace* but yours will be different

Type the following into your console or terminal:

    ssh alovelace@turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu

## Our working environment

### turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu ![turing](images/turing.jpg)

### Motivations

In the first part of the semester we will be connecting to the same server.  
There are several reasons for this:

* Easier setup for students at the start of class
* Everyone is working in the same environment
* The environment is less likely to be damaged by a sudo accident.
* Remote server is a realistic working scenario
* We can have some fun.

## Commands in this lesson

Some of these commands will be covered in the videos, and some in the assignments.

I suggest you note what each of the following does as you go through the vieos.  Before taking the quiz use the "man" utility to figure out what the other commands do.  (Using man will be covered in one of this unit's videos.)

* whoami
* exit
* echo
* cowsay
* figlet
* date
* cal
* finger
* ls
* wget
* chfn
* finger
* passwd
* mkpasswd
* cal
* ping
  
## Keystrokes used in this lesson
  
* Ctrl-c
* Up-arrow
* tab
  
## Commands

* case sensitive
* often terse or parsimonious
  * old commands are often 2 or 3 letters
  * often no unneeded output.  Sometimes none

## Strings

  There are several ways to make strings  For right now we will only talk about three ways

* Naked
  * Best used when there are no spaces or punctuation
  
```bash
$ echo Hello
$ cowsay Hello
```

* Single Quote '
  * an apostrophy to a normal human
  * may be used around single words
  * more efficient than double quotes
  * useful when the string includes double quotes
  * **Best practice is to get in the habit of using single quotes**

```bash
$ echo 'Hello, World'
$ cowsay 'Hello, World'
$ cowsay 'Hello, $USER'
$ cowsay 'He said "Where is Dave?"'
```

* Double Quote "
  * just a normal quote mark to a normal human
  * may be used around single words
  * less efficient than double quotes
  * useful when string includes apostrophe "Dave's not here."
  
```bash
   Hit the up arrow once and change the single quotes to double
$ cowsay "Hello, $USER"
$ cowsay -w "Hello, $USER"
$ cowsay -t "Hello, $USER"
$ cowsay -d "Hello, $USER"

```

### Getting out of trouble with Ctrl-c

It is easy to forget a closing quote mark.  If that happens it may look like the
 system is hung up.  Don't panic.  Hold down the Ctrl key and hit c.  Ctrl-C is
 often called ***"Break"*** and can be your best friend.

Type the following command.  It measure verifies that we have a network connection
 and measures the time it takes to send messages to computer.  
(There are a thousand milliseconds in a second, so 100 ms would be a tenth of a second.)

$ ping example.com

The problem is the command runs forever.  Hit Ctrl-c to break.

Now try the following while logged into turing

```bash
$ ping www.missouriwestern.edu
$ ping turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu
```

## Pipes Interlude

Pipes will not be on this quiz.  Pipes will be covered in a later unit.  
However, in this unit we will introduce using them.  Hopefully they will
not feel as odd when we get to them.

Most commands can take their input from the keyboard and send send output to the screen.

Commands can be combined with a | (or "pipe") symbol.  It is usually on the
right side of the keyboard above the enter key.

Try this:

``` bash
$ date
```

Now "pipe" the output of the date command as input to the cowsay command.

```bash
$ date  |  cowsay
```

Reminder.  Pipes will not be on the Unit 1 quiz.  But they are useful and pretty easy.

## Man Pages

Man is short for "manuals"

A lot of the commands seem weird.  But they are also used in a couple of other
 programs so learning the common ones pay off.

* ***"q" to quit.***
* "h" gets you help.
* The man command uses the "less" program. More on less later.
* Space moves you forward one page.  But you can use page up and page down.
* / for forward search.  Then n to move to next match or N for previous match

The ^ symbol means "Ctrl"

### Keystrokes in man pages

* q
* space (same as PgDn)
* PgUp
* /
* n and N (they are different in man pages)

* **Bold** text means to use it exactly.
* *Italics* or italics means substiture with something approrpriate.
* [optional]  There are variations.  See the help pages, but the most important
thing is that [ ] means the arguments are optional.

### The man command

```bash
man cowsay
```

#### Description

Text at the beginning

#### Options

Cowsay uses "old style" options.

* Dash followed by a single letter

Use "man cowsay" and find out what the following options do:

* -d
* -t
* -w
* -l

Now do cowsay with each of the above

```bash
$ cowsay -d  "He's dead, Jim."
$ cowsay -t  "I'm tired"
$ cowsay -w  "Too much coffee"
$ cowsay -l
```

Some options take a paremeter.  Use man to look at the -W and -f options.  (Note that -w and -W are different)

The parameter may be separated by whitespace

```bash
$ date | cowsay
$ date | cowsay -W 12
$ date | cowsay -W 12
$ fortune | cowsay
$ fortune | cowsay -W 20
$ fortune | cowsay -W60

### Muliple Options in the Same Command

Options can often be used separately

```bash
$ cowsay -d -w10 'I am wider than 10 characters'
```

Options may be combined.  If an option takes a parameterit must be last

```bash
$ cowsay -dw10   'I am wider than 10 characters'
```

Sometimes it doesn't make sense to combine commands.

```bash
$ cowsay -dwt "I'm not sure if I am dead, wired, or tired"
$ cowsay -dl
```

#### Putting things together, and some fun

* Check the man page and see what the -l and -f options do.

What happens with the following?

```bash
$ cowsay -f tux "Tux the Penguin is the mascot of Linux."
```

#### wget

* Use the man page to figure out what the "wget" command does.
* Use the man page to figure out what the ls command does.
* Go to <https://github.com/paulkaefer/cowsay-files/tree/master/cows> in your browser (Chrome, firefox, etc)
* Find the file dilbert.cow
* Click the "Raw" button over toward the right.  It should give you just the contents of the file.
* Copy the URL for the raw dilbert.cow file
* Use wget to get the data from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulkaefer/cowsay-files/master/cows/dilbert.cow>
* Use the ls command all by itself and verify that the dilbert.cow file is in your home directory.
* Make dilbert say something.
* If your terminal displays color you should be mildly impressed.  If it doesn't, it isn't so great.  In that case get R2-D2 and try it.
* Slightly tricky challenge.  Get ackbar and have him say ***It's a trap!***  (Hint:  It's a trap!)

### Extended Options

DO ***man date*** and look at the -d option

Notice that it has two versions of many of the options.  There is both -d and --date

The following two commands are identical:

```bash
$ date -d 2020-02-29
$ date --date 2020-02-29
```

Use them either way.

### Man page of the man command

The man system is a system of documentation.  There are many sections.

For this course we will be concerned with Section 1 which is the default.  We may touch on a few others, but 1 is our goto section.

| Section | Content |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Executable programs or shell commands |
| 2 | System calls (functions provided by the kernel) |
| 3 | Library calls (functions within program libraries) |
| 4 | Special files (usually found in /dev) |
| 5 | File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd |
| 6 | Games |
| 7 | Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7) |
| 8 | System administration commands (usually only for root) |
| 9 | Kernel routines [Non standard] |

Section numbers are given at the top of the page.

You can specify section numbers

```bash
$ man 1 ls
$ man 4 ls
```
