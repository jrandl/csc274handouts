# Picking a decent password

Passwords are important!

## Bits

A bit is a place that stores a 0 or a 1.

If you have 2 bits you can have up to 4 combinations

```text
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```

If you have 3 bits you can have up to 8 combinations

```text
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
```

In general, if you have n bits, then the number of combinations is 2<sup>n</sup>

| number of bits | unique patterns |
| :------------: | :-------------: |
|       1        |        2        |
|       2        |        4        |
|       3        |        8        |
|       4        |       16        |
|       5        |       32        |
|       6        |       64        |
|       7        |       128       |
|       8        |       256       |
|       9        |       512       |
|       10       |      1024       |
|       20       |    1,048,576    |
|       30       |  1,073,741,824  |

## Entropy

Entropy is lack of order or predictability.  For passwords, password strength is measured in bits of entropy.

![Entropy Formula](images/entropy.gif)

Range is the number of characters in the character set

| Description                    | Range |
| ------------------------------ | :---: |
| digits only                    |  10   |
| lower case only                |  26   |
| upper case only                |  26   |
| upper+lower                    |  52   |
| upper+lower+digits             |  62   |
| upper+lower+digits+10 specials |  72   |

### [Entropy Calculator](http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php)

* The following table is now considered too conservative.  
* Probably bump each category up 1 level.  
* :star: IT Professionals should have all passwords above 65. :star:
*128 is now considered standard for major assets

| Bits of Entropy | Strength                                                                  |
| :-------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    < 28 bits    | Very Weak; might keep out family members                                  |
|  28 - 35 bits   | Weak; should keep out most people, often good for desktop login passwords |
|  36 - 59 bits   | Reasonable; fairly secure passwords for network and company passwords     |
|  60 - 127 bits  | Strong; can be good for guarding financial information                    |
128+ bits = Very Strong; often overkill

## How to weaken passwords

Use common passwords

* See [this list of longstanding popular passwords](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/PwnedPasswordTop100k.txt)
* Hot password of the era.
  * "Donald" and "Trump" are popular now along with common variations like Drump
  * Any password or username used in a movie or TV show
  * *Requiring* users to use upper case, numbers, etc.
