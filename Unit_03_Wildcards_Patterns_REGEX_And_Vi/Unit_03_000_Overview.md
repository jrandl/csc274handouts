# Unit 03 00 Overview

## Unix development realities

### How software develops

When software is developed new features are added over time.  Unix is no different.  We will see the addition of features and capabilites over time.  

* The OS has to deal with files from the beginning.  Therefore the most basic patterns were developed for working with files.
* Working with text files came a little later.  The ```grep``` command came along.  They built on the ```ls``` command and added more capability.
* egrep added extended the basic grep options
* Perl and other high-level languages extend well beyond the extended grep commands.  Later in the course we will see a little of these in the ```sed``` command.  The extended commands from Perl are generally the basis of REGEX in Java, Python, C++, PHP, JavaScript, and other languages.

## What to remember

This unit is all about Pattern matching.  Different pattern systems are available in different parts of the system.
