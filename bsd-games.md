# BSD Games

This is a list of "games" in the BSD-Games package

If a command appears to hang up and do nothing, you should be able to do Ctrl+c (Control key plus C) to break out.  Ctrl+d might also work.

Many of these games do have ```man``` pages.

Not all of these are games in the strict use of the term.  Some of them are really utilities, and others are displays.

Some of these games may not be on our system.
