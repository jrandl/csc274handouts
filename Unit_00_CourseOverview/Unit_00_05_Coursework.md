# Unit 00_05 Videos and Notes
## A how-to

## "Flipped Class"

* The videos are intended to replace the lectures.
* Homework is done during class periods.

## Videos

* Videos replace the lectures
* This is a 2-credit-hour class, so I aim at roughly 100 minutes of video per week 
* I try to break them into shorter videos
  * It is hard to stay focused on long videos
  * It is hard to make long videos
    * I tend to re-record rather than edit
  * It is easier for students to keep track of where you are
  * These pages in the github repo generally correspond to PowerPoints or handouts.
    * [https://github.com/noynaert/csc274repo](https://github.com/noynaert/csc274repo)
    * Generally 1 repo page per video
    * Should you print them out?

Please remember that the videos are not intended to be professional grade.  They are *always* a work in progress.  Lectures are not perfect, either.

## Notes pages

    
### Steps to get points for the notes

* Print them out, hopefully on campus from the "free" printers in computer labs
* The notes will be in the Canvas. A link is in the assignment.
* There is one set of notes pages for the entire unit
  * Individual videos and notes are organized into sections
* Watch the videos and fill out the notes by handwriting
    * Should generally follow the sequence of the videos
    * You might need to check the handouts
    * You might need to pause videos to check the handouts, look up something, or test the idea in your terminal application.
* Make them into a single PDF file 
  * The most prefered format is a single .pdf file from a flatbed scanner
  * Second best is a single .pdf file from a "camscan" app
  * If you have to take indivdual pictures, combine them into a single .pdf file.  
    * for the first couple of weeks you can turn in individual files.
    * We will do an exercise where we do this at the command line with imagemagic after about week 3.  After that exercise you will need to turn in a single .pdf file no matter what you use to make the individual files.

  * Upload the file with hand-written notes into the Canvas Assignment

  ### How I grade the notes

  The real purpose of the notes is to help watch the videos.

  I only "spot grade" a few questions and look for completeness.

## Homework

There will also be real homework.  This will typically be a set of tasks you must perform.  

## Exams and Homework

* Based on *both* the Github handouts plus the notes.  You should study from both.
