\begin{document}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Print out these pages.  If you do not have access to a printer, please contact the instructor.
	\item Handwrite your answers on the pages you print out. 
	   \begin{itemize}
		  \item \textbf{I will not accept just the answers written on a sheet of paper.}  
		  \item \textbf{I will not accept typed output.}
	   \end{itemize}
	\item If you have a flatbed scanner, please scan the images into a .pdf file.  
	  \begin{itemize}
         \item PDF files are much better than individual jpg files.
         \item If you don't have a flatbed scanner, please use a "camscanner" app on your phone to produce a single .pdf file for the assignment.
      \end{itemize}

	\item The video notes are intended as \textbf{learning aids} and not grading exercises.
	\item Watch the videos and fill these pages out as you go.
	\item I will only spot check a few questions and look for completeness.  There are only a few ways you can lose points:
	   \begin{itemize}
	     \item Skip a question or give a frivolous answer. 
		 \item Just copy some answer you found on the internet.  Instead, use your own words.
	     \item Cheat.  Don't use another student's answers, although it is fine (and encouraged) if you talk over specific questions with another student.  Just be sure to give your own answer and don't copy another student.  Also, don't use notes from another semester; I can be sneaky.
	   \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

If you don't know an answer try to figure it out.  Instead of an answer,
write about what you do understand or why you are confused.  Maybe put a big \textcolor{BrickRed}{\Huge*} or \textcolor{BrickRed}{\Huge?} in the margin next to 
the question.
